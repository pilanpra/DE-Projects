Dental care and research are currently transforming into what we term data dentistry, with 3 main applications: 1) medical data analysis uses deep learning, allowing one to master unprecedented amounts of data (language, speech, imagery) and put them to productive use. 2) Data-enriched clinical care integrates data from individual (e.g., demographic, social, clinical and omics data, consumer data), setting (e.g., geospatial, environmental, provider-related data), and systems level (payer or regulatory data to characterize input, throughput, output, and outcomes of health care) to provide a comprehensive and continuous real-time assessment of biologic perturbations, individual behaviors, and context. \n\n\"Data for research include open research data and data sharing, allowing one to appraise, benchmark, pool, replicate, and reuse data. Concerns and confidence into data-driven applications, stakeholders' and system's capabilities, and lack of data standardization and harmonization currently limit the development and implementation of data dentistry.\"\n\n\"Aspects of bias and data-user interaction require attention.

This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery.\"\n\n\"AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility.\"\n\n\"Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness.\"\n\n\"Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (\"explainable AI\"). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32315260/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Some Visualization\ndf[['adv_user_cnt', 'calendar_year']].value_counts().head().plot(kind='barh')\n\nplt.title('Patients count 2018 Year?');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-31T21:33:40.970442Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-31T21:33:40.970872Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-31T21:33:41.241611Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-31T21:33:40.970746Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-31T21:33:41.240294Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#A DDS (Dental Doctor) with only 11-16 patients during any year would be so screwed : ) ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#I love you Fabrizio.
